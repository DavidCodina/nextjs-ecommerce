# The Neon Vercel Integration is set up to automatically delete obsolete database branches.
# A database branch is marked as obsolete in Neon when it's been deleted from GitHub.
# However, if there's still an associated Vercel preview deployment then the database branch
# will NOT be deleted. In theory, if we also deleted any associated Vercel preview deployments then
# the Neon database branch would eventually get deleted. In my experience, this still doesn't happen
# or simply takes too long. This GitHub workflow ensures that the database branch is deleted immediately.
# However, the project's current vercel.json is still opting out of excessive preview deployments, but we
# could remove this and the workflow would work great.

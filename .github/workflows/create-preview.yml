  # The job of this workflow is to generate create an ephemeral Neon database branch,
  # run Prisma migrations against that branch, and then deploy a preview to Vercel.
  # By default,

  #   https://vercel.com/docs/git/vercel-for-github#a-deployment-for-each-push
  #   "Vercel for GitHub will deploy every push by default. This includes
  #   pushes and pull requests made to branches" This is explicitly stated here:
  #
  # I'm not sure if this was always the case. From watching tutorials that are a few
  # years old, they always only ever mention preview deployments on pull request.
  # In any case, having automatic preview deployments for all branch pushes is a bit
  # too heavy-handed. This is especially true if you're using the Vercel/Neon integration,
  # which generates a new Neon branch for every preview deployment. Doing that will burn
  # through your Neon non-default branch compute credits very quickly! Ultimately, for
  # more fine-grained control, you really need to create a custom workflow.
  #
  #
  # Don't forget to disable automatic preview deployments in Vercel dashboard.
  # Don't forget to disconnect from Vercel/Neon integration.

  # Gotcha:
  #
  #   Unhandled Rejection: Error [PrismaClientInitializationError]: Prisma Client could
  #   not locate the Query Engine for runtime "rhel-openssl-3.0.x". This happened because Prisma
  #   Client was generated for "debian-openssl-3.0.x", but the actual deployment required "rhel-openssl-3.0.x".
  #   Add "rhel-openssl-3.0.x" to `binaryTargets` in the "schema.prisma" file and run `prisma generate`
  #   after saving it. Add this to the generator client in schema.prisma: provider = "prisma-client-js"
  #
  # The error arises from a platform mismatch between your GitHub Actions environment (Ubuntu/debian)
  # and Vercel's runtime environment (rhel). Prisma Client requires platform-specific Query Engine
  # binaries matched to the deployment environment. Your workflow built Prisma Client for
  # debian-openssl-3.0.x (Ubuntu), but Vercel's serverless environment uses rhel-openssl-3.0.x
  #
  # GitHub Actions Runners Use Ubuntu. This means that Prisma was generated for Ubuntu (Debian-based)
  # when your workflow executed the prisma generate command. However, when your app is deployed to Vercel,
  # the runtime expects RHEL-based binaries—hence the PrismaClientInitializationError.
